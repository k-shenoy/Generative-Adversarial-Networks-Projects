1. Check ability of network on non-anime, 64x64 dataset
 - build sample 64x64 dataset with simple task (signs, common objects, etc.)
 - construct network according to book specifications
 - train, test
 - finetune network hyper-paramaters

~~If 1 produces strong result
2. Check ability of network on larger input images
 - Restructure network for larger input size
 - Train, Test with enlarged images or new dataset
 - Repeat until network can handle acceptable resolution
 - maybe consider minor post-generation upsampling

3. Curate datasets for abstract ideas
 - Find solution for aspect ratio problem
 - Find dataset/scraping method for high resolution art
	 - Consider dataset broadness/generalizability
 - Train, Test, Finetune
